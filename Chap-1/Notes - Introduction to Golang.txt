Go Lang - Day 1
---------------

Legacy programming languages like python, C, C++ have some issues.
 Go solves all those issues because of the following features-

compiled language, not like python which is an interpreted language!!

1) It is strong and statically typed
2) faster compile time
3) legacy programming languages have complex typed formats which makes it 
more complex as they keep upgrading themselves


Go Lang syntax
---------------

# hello world program

package main

 # main function inside main package is going to be our entry point

import {
	"fmt"
}

func main(){
	fmt.Println("Hello, playground")
}


fmt - formatted i/o
